# Robotics Parts App

This repository hosts the content of our "Parts App", made by Team 2638.

This app was made using React Native. It's basically a cheatsheet, but for parts that are used frequently when building robots.
Each part has a:
* Name
* Image(s)
* Description
* Where it can be found
* Where it can be bought

and all the pages are dynamically generated from one giant JSON file.
